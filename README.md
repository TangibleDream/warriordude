....Ah to dream

There's not much in this game for those who won't help the townsfolk keep the monsters at bay. So a trip the Dungeon is in order.

There are monsters to fight in the dungeon. Take out monsters to gain experience and coin to spend in town. Or at least flee before your demise.

Spend your money at the shops, from arms and armor, to healing potions.  There is something there for any adventurer

As you gain levels your abilities will increase as well. This unfortunately tends to attract more powerful creatures as well, so good luck!
